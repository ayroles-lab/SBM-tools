# Raw data files

Place raw data files for each layered network here, in their own folder, they will not be modified.
Input files should be batch corrected, with genes in the rows, samples in the columns.
Input files should have a tsv extension and be in tab separated format, with column and row names.
Row names will be used to label the graph vertices. 
Each input file will define one layer in the network, and the name of the folder will be used as the label.
